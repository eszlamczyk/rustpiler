# Rustpiler

I wanted to learn rust, and learn compilers. So in my stroke of brigtness I've decided to do both at the same time (I know that combining new language and new project is silly, but bite me). At least I have what to do outside uni and work :/

## rust stuff
rust stuff is rust stuff just spamming

```
cargo run
```

## C stuff
In the article Im using as a reference they use a lot of C to show the assembly code. So I **STOLE** the idea from them.

So basicly `C/` is junk

But if you for some god forseaken reason want to try this yourself

```
cd C
cargo run
gcc ./runer_tester.c ./rust_test.s -o test
./test
```
